# Open Ethereum Indexer

Open Ethereum Indexer is a flexible and modular blockchain indexing service that allows you to index, query, and monitor Ethereum (or any other EVM-compatible chain) blockchain data. It provides a modular architecture for building applications that need to track and/or index blockchain events and transactions.

It is designed to allow you to quickly build a custom blockchain monitoring solution with support for indexing without having to worry about the technical details of blockchain monitoring and indexing.

## Why Use Open Ethereum Indexer?

Building blockchain applications often requires tracking on-chain events and state changes. Open Ethereum Indexer provides:

- A ready-to-use infrastructure for monitoring blockchain activity
- Real-time blockchain event tracking and backfilling from a historical block
- Postgres database for storing indexed data
- Customizable event and block handlers
- Optional API and GraphQL endpoints for querying indexed data
- Modular architecture for easy extension and customization
- Support for any network (including custom networks) that conforms to the [Ethereum JSON RPC Specification](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/)
- Monitoring and metrics with Prometheus

## Technical Architecture

Open Ethereum Indexer is built on [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/), providing a dependency-injected application that's easy to extend. It connects to an Ethereum node via JSON-RPC and processes blocks and events as they occur on the blockchain.

Data is stored in PostgreSQL, allowing for efficient querying and retrieval of indexed information. The app uses [TypeORM](https://typeorm.io/) to interact with the database which should be used for any database operations inside event handlers too.

## Use Cases

Open Ethereum Indexer is ideal for:

- DeFi applications that need to track token swaps, deposits, or other financial events
- NFT marketplaces requiring indexing of transfers and sales
- DAOs that want to monitor governance events
- Applications that want to be notified if on-chain events meeting specific criteria occur
- Any application that needs to store, query and analyze on-chain data
