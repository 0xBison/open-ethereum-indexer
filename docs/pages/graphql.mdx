# GraphQL Support

> GraphQL support is currently experimental and only works with generic entities (those created through the generic indexing system). Custom entities and blocks are not yet supported.

Open Ethereum Indexer provides built-in GraphQL support, allowing you to query your indexed data using GraphQL. This page explains how to enable and use the GraphQL API in your indexer application.

## Configuration

GraphQL support can be configured through your indexer configuration:

```typescript
const indexerConfig: IndexerConfig = {
  // ...other config
  app: {
    disableGraphql: false, // Set to true to completely disable GraphQL
    disableGraphqlPlayground: false, // Set to true to disable the GraphQL playground while keeping the API
  },
};
```

## Accessing the GraphQL Playground

Once enabled, you can access the GraphQL playground at:

```text
http://localhost:3050/graphql
```

Replace `3050` with your configured port if different.

> **Note**: The GraphQL playground can be disabled via the `disableGraphqlPlayground` configuration option while keeping the GraphQL API endpoint active.
