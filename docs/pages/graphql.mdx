# GraphQL Support

> GraphQL support is currently experimental and only works with generic entities (those created through the generic indexing system). Nested entities are not yet supported.

Open Ethereum Indexer provides built-in GraphQL support, allowing you to query your indexed data using GraphQL. This page explains how to enable and use the GraphQL API in your indexer application.

## Configuration

GraphQL support can be configured through your indexer configuration:

```typescript
const indexerConfig: IndexerConfig = {
  // ...other config
  app: {
    disableGraphql: false, // Set to true to completely disable GraphQL
    disableGraphqlPlayground: false, // Set to true to disable the GraphQL playground while keeping the API
  },
};
```

## Accessing the GraphQL Playground

Once enabled, you can access the GraphQL playground at:

```text
http://localhost:3050/graphql
```

Replace `3050` with your configured port if different.

> **Note**: The GraphQL playground can be disabled via the `disableGraphqlPlayground` configuration option while keeping the GraphQL API endpoint active.

## Available Queries

### Block Queries

The following queries are available for accessing block data:

```graphql
# Get the latest indexed block
query GetLatestBlock {
  latestBlock {
    id
    blockNumber
    processedAt
  }
}

# Get a specific block by number
query GetBlock {
  block(blockNumber: 1234567) {
    id
    blockNumber
    processedAt
  }
}

# Get a paginated list of blocks
query GetBlocks {
  blocks(limit: 10, offset: 0) {
    id
    blockNumber
    processedAt
  }
}
```

### Event Queries

For each event type you index, the following queries are automatically generated:

```graphql
# Example for a Transfer event
query GetTransfers {
  Transfer(limit: 10, offset: 0) {
    uniqueEventId
    eventOriginAddress
    blockNumber
    blockTimestamp
    transactionHash
    logIndex
    from
    to
    value
  }
}
```

Each event query supports:

- `limit`: Number of records to return (default: 10)
- `offset`: Number of records to skip (default: 0)
- `filter`: Optional filters for specific fields
