# Block Monitoring

The Open Ethereum Indexer provides a robust system for monitoring new blocks on the blockchain. This page explains how to set up block handlers and process blockchain blocks in your application.
It is similar to [event listening](/event-listening), but triggers for blocks instead of events.

### Registering Block Handlers

You can register block handlers using the `onBlock` function:

```typescript
import { onBlock } from '@open-ethereum/indexer';

onBlock({
  onIndex: async (payload) => {
    // This code runs when a block is indexed
    console.log('Block indexed:', payload);

    // Access block data
    const { number, hash, timestamp } = payload;
    console.log(
      `Block #${number} with hash ${hash} at ${new Date(timestamp * 1000)}`,
    );

    // Store block data or trigger other actions
  },
  onDeindex: async (payload) => {
    // This code runs if a block is deindexed (during a chain reorganization)
    console.log('Block deindexed:', payload);

    // Remove or update stored data as necessary
  },
});
```

### Block Payload

The block handler receives a payload with the following structure:

```typescript
import { Log } from '@ethersproject/abstract-provider';

export interface BlockEvent {
  hash: string;
  number: number;
  parent: string;
  timestamp: number;
  logs: Array<Log>;
}
```

## Example: Block Notifier

The [block notifier example](/example-block-notifier) shows how to use block listening to notify every 1,000,000 blocks.
