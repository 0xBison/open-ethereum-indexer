# Contributing

We welcome contributions to the Open Ethereum Indexer project! This guide will help you understand how to contribute to the project effectively.

## Getting Started

### Setting Up the Development Environment

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/open-ethereum-indexer-new.git
cd open-ethereum-indexer-new
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

4. Build the project:

```bash
pnpm build
```

5. Run the tests:

```bash
pnpm test
```

### Project Structure

The project is organized as a monorepo with the following structure:

```
open-ethereum-indexer-new/
├── packages/
│   └── indexer/            # Core indexer package
├── examples/               # Example applications
│   ├── basic-example/
│   ├── block-notifier/
│   └── ...
├── docs/                   # Documentation site

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug, please report it by creating an issue on GitHub. When reporting bugs, please include:

1. A clear and descriptive title
2. Steps to reproduce the bug
3. Expected behavior
4. Actual behavior
5. Environment information (OS, Node.js version, etc.)

### Suggesting Enhancements

We love hearing about new ideas! To suggest an enhancement:

1. Create an issue on GitHub with the label "enhancement"
2. Clearly describe the feature/enhancement
3. Explain why this would be valuable to the project
4. If possible, outline how it might be implemented

### Pull Requests

We follow a standard GitHub flow for contributions:

1. Create a new branch for your feature or bugfix:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/your-bugfix-name
```

2. Make your changes, following the code style and guidelines
3. Write tests for your changes
4. Run the tests to ensure everything passes:

```bash
pnpm test
```

5. Commit your changes with a descriptive commit message using [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```bash
git commit -m "feat: add new feature X"
# or
git commit -m "fix: resolve issue with Y"
```

6. Push your branch to your fork:

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

7. Create a pull request against the `main` branch of the main repository

### Code Style and Guidelines

- We use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow the existing code style (enforced by ESLint and Prettier)
- Write clear, commented code
- Maintain backward compatibility where possible
- Write unit tests for new features and bug fixes

## Development Workflow

### Running Tests

Run all tests:

```bash
pnpm test
```

Run specific tests:

```bash
pnpm test -- -t "feature name"
```

### Running Examples

To run an example:

```bash
cd examples/basic-example
pnpm install
pnpm start:dev
```

### Building Documentation

To build and run the documentation locally:

```bash
cd docs
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

The documentation will be available at http://localhost:3000.

## Creating New Examples

We encourage contributors to create new examples! To add a new example:

1. Create a new directory in `examples/`:

```bash
mkdir examples/my-new-example
```

2. Set up the basic structure (use an existing example as a template)
3. Add a README.md explaining the purpose and usage of the example
4. Add documentation in `docs/pages/examples/` for your example

## Documentation

When adding new features, please also update the relevant documentation:

1. Add or update the appropriate page in `docs/pages/`
2. If it's a major feature, consider adding an example demonstrating its use

## Release Process

The maintainers follow these steps for releases:

1. Update the version in the package.json files
2. Update the CHANGELOG.md using [conventional-changelog](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog)
3. Create a git tag for the version
4. Push the tag to GitHub
5. Publish the package to npm

## Getting Help

If you need help with your contribution:

1. Check the documentation
2. Open a discussion on GitHub
3. Ask in the project's Discord channel
