# Proxy Contract Example

This example demonstrates how to properly index events from a proxy contract pattern, specifically using Compound's Comptroller contract as an example.

## Key Components

### 1. Entity Generation

The example uses `solidity-events-to-typeorm` to automatically generate TypeORM entities from contract ABIs. This is configured in `scripts/generate.ts`:

```typescript
export const config: Config = {
  output: {
    path: outputPath,
    entities: path.resolve(outputPath, './entities/'),
    abis: path.resolve(outputPath, './abi/'),
  },
  migrations: {
    path: path.resolve(outputPath, './migrations/'),
    migrationName: 'InitialSchema',
    schemaName: 'SQL_SCHEMA',
    schemaVariable: true,
  },
  docs: {
    path: path.resolve(outputPath, './docs/'),
  },
  contracts: {
    ComptrollerProxy: {
      abi: ComptrollerImplementation,
    },
  },
};
```

This generates:

- Entity classes for each event in the ABI (e.g., `DistributedSupplierCompEntity_2de01bb4`)
- Database migrations for creating the tables
- API documentation for the generated entities

### 2. ABI Merging

The example shows how to handle proxy contracts by merging the ABIs:

```typescript
abi: mergeEventAbis(proxyAbi, implementationAbi);
```

## How It Works

1. **Entity Generation Process**:

   - Run `pnpm generate-entities` to process the ABIs
   - Creates TypeORM entities in `src/output/entities/`
   - Generates migrations in `src/output/migrations/`
   - All generated entities extend `BlockchainEventEntity` for common fields

2. **Generated Entities Include**:

   - `DistributedSupplierCompEntity_2de01bb4`
   - `DistributedBorrowerCompEntity_8bcf5026`
   - Other event entities from the Comptroller contract

3. **Auto-Generated Fields**:
   Each entity automatically includes blockchain event fields like:
   - `uniqueEventId`
   - `blockNumber`
   - `transactionHash`
   - `blockTimestamp`
   - Event-specific fields from the ABI

## Setup and Usage

1. Generate entities from ABIs:

```bash
pnpm generate-entities
```

2. Copy `.env.example` file to `.env` file and set up environment variables:

```env
NODE_RPC_URL=<your-ethereum-node-url>
CHAIN_ID=1
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

4. Run the indexer:

```bash
pnpm start
```

The generated entities require no additional code to index events - they're automatically populated when matching events are found on-chain.
